Computational Musicology

PLEASE DO NOT SHOW THIS PORTFOLIO IN CLASS

The corpus I chose for Computational Musicology is playlists with the label "Workout". During covid, I often went to the gym to get out of the house. And if I went to the gym, I always took my phone and Air Pods with me. Music was an essential part of my gym workouts. And I always listen to the label "Workout" on Spotify during my sessions. So, what does it mean to be a "workout" playlist? One thing that interests me is that it needs to give you energy because you are exercising, and you do not want to stop. It needs to help you focus on your movements. And you don't want to get bored or feel the pain from the exercise. Another exciting thing for me is the question, "how does a "workout" playlist distinguish itself from another playlist?". Workout music often has a bumping beat, but party music can also have this, so what is the difference between party music and workout music. And does all the workout music have lyrics or not to keep yourself motivated, or is this not necessary. One should consider the emotions, memories, and associations that different songs evoke. For some people, the extent to which they identify with the singer's emotional state and viewpoint determines how motivated they feel
